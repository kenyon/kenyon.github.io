title: Firefox

Setting the default application in the "you have chosen to open" dialog box: as of Firefox (Iceweasel) 20.0, in `~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list`, add a line like this to the Default Applications section:

```conf
application/pdf=kde4-okularApplication_pdf.desktop
```

This overrides the settings in `/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache`, which is autogenerated by `update-desktop-database`. So now you have to manually sync your local mimeapps.list with mimeinfo.cache if you just want to change the program that is selected by default in the "you have chosen to open" dialog box. Dumb. I like to use Firefox's built-in PDF previewer most of the time, but when I want to download a PDF, I want to have Okular selected to open it by default, not GIMP.

Here are some Firefox config items I like to set:

* accessibility.typeaheadfind.prefillwithselection true
* browser.backspace_action 0
* browser.blink_allowed false
* browser.download.manager.showAlertOnComplete false
* browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab false
* browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent true
* browser.urlbar.trimURLs false
* browser.xul.error_pages.expert_bad_cert true
* font.size.fixed.x-western 14 (can set this using the GUI)
* layout.spellcheckDefault 2
* network.http.pipelining.ssl true
* network.http.pipelining true
* network.http.proxy.pipelining true
* plugins.hide_infobar_for_missing_plugin true
