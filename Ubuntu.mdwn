Some of my notes on using Ubuntu Linux.

## Disabling touchpad tapping
For some annoying reason, it's very difficult to disable touchpad tap clicking, which is on by default. TODO: Figure out how to disable this. Maybe try making a karmic package of [kcm_touchpad](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/kcm_touchpad?content=113335).

## Right Alt produces wrong keysym, ISO_Level3_Shift
I had this problem on my [[Debian]] machine too. It should produce Alt_R. The solution is to run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup` and select No AltGr key. I suspect this is related to selecting [[Dvorak|Dvorak keyboard]] as my keyboard layout.
