This page documents my project to build a stratum 1 NTP [[!wikipedia time server]] at my house.

## GPS selection

I selected the [Garmin GPS 18x LVC](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016O3T7A) for the following reasons:

* Plenty of documentation exists by people who have used this unit as an NTP timing source.
* The receiver and antenna are integrated into one enclosure.
* Minimal assembly and soldering necessary, compared to bare-board receivers.
* Available on [Amazon](http://amazon.com/) for a decent price.

I ordered the 18x (and a [serial cable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZKNANO)) on Amazon on 2011-09-05. It should be delivered by UPS on 2011-09-09.
