This is my [Debian](http://debian.org/) page.

Since March 2009, I'm running [Debian squeeze](http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/) on my main workstation.

Since March 2010, I'm running Debian squeeze on my [[Dell Latitude 2100]] netbook.

Since June 2010, I'm running Debian squeeze on my Dell Latitude D520.

## debconf
Make it so all questions are asked: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure debconf` and answer lowest priority.

## disable console beep
    modprobe -r pcspkr
    echo blacklist pcspkr >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist

Set 'bell-style' to 'none' in `/etc/inputrc`.
