This page contains code I've written and want to make public, which
doesn't fit anywhere else on my site. Most of my work is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kenyon) and
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/kenyon).

## packages.rb
Puppet Facter custom fact (written in Ruby). Returns a list of

to the version. Works with Debian and Red Hat family operating
systems.
