This is my [Debian](http://debian.org/) page.

Since March 2009, I'm running [Debian squeeze](http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/) on my main workstation.

Since March 2010, I'm running Debian squeeze on my [[Dell Latitude 2100]] netbook.

## 6to4 init script
Here is a script I wrote for a Debian-style `/etc/init.d` that configures a [[!wikipedia 6to4]] IPv6 tunnel.

* <http://kenyonralph.com/6to4>

Dependencies:

* [[!debpkg iproute]]
* [[!debpkg moreutils]]
* [[!debpkg perl]]
* [[!debpkg curl]]

## debconf
Make it so all questions are asked: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure debconf` and answer lowest priority.

## disable console beep
[[!format sh """
modprobe -r pcspkr
echo blacklist pcspkr >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
"""]]

Set 'bell-style' to 'none' in `/etc/inputrc`.

`setterm -blength 0`
